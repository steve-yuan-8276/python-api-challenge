# Python Api Challenge

## Solution:

### Part 1: WeatherPy

#### Solution File
    
    Please check the file: WeatherPy.ipynb

#### Output File
    - output_data/cities.csv
    - output_data/Fig1.png (City Max Temperature VS Temperature)
    - output_data/Fig2.png (City Max Temperature VS Humidity)
    - output_data/Fig3.png (City Max Temperature VS Cloudiness)
    - output_data/Fig4.png (City Max Temperature VS Wind Speed)

#### Analysis
    An analysis was conducted on the relationship between latitude and maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres using scatter plots and linear regression models. For detailed information, please refer to the relevant sections of WeatherPy.ipynb.

### Part 2: VacationPy

#### Solution File
    
    Please check the file: VacationPy.ipynb

#### Output File

The map generated in Jupyter Notebook displays correctly locally, but cannot be displayed after being uploaded to GitHub. Therefore, I saved the map in HTML and PNG formats. The addresses are as follows:

    1.city_locations_map 
    Output File: 
    - output_data/city_locations_map.html
    - output_data/city_locations_map.png

    2.hotel_map.png
    Output File: 
    - output_data/hotel_map.html
    - output_data/hotel_map.png
